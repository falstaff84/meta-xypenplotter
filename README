This is a demo layer how to extend the Toradex BSP layer to create an
altered image. This demo uses its own layer since several additional
software packages and an altered kernel is required.

This layer requires a working Toradex BSP setup (with meta-toradex),
see
http://developer.toradex.com/software-resources/arm-family/linux/board-support-package/openembedded-(core)

Then, do this steps:
1. Clone this repository to your layer folder (stuff folder).
2. Add this layer to your conf/bblayers.conf in your build directory.

Finally call bitbake to build the specific image:
3. $ MACHINE=colibri-vf bitbake qt4e-xyplotter-image

To create a SDK which includes Qt Embedded and libmcc as well
4. $ MACHINE=colibri-vf bitbake -k meta-toolchain-qte-xyprinter
